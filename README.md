### Jamie Hardie
Pronouns: He / Him

I am a beginner Python developer and career changer looking to get started with machine learning and data science.
I have an MA in Linguistics and a strong interest in NLP.

I'm currently learning intermediate Python and as much as I can about NLP principles.

I'm looking for work in the data sector, particularly training positions.

There is not much here at the moment but I hope to add projects as I gain experience.
